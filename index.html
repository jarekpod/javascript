				<p>Last Christmas 
				<br>
				I gave you my heart 
				<br>
				But the very next day 
				<br>
				You gave it away 
				<br>
				This year 
				<br>
				To save me from tears 
				<br>
				I'll give it to someone special 
				<br>
				<br>
				Last Christmas 
				<br>
				I gave you my heart 
				<br>
				But the very next day 
				<br>
				You gave it away (you gave it away)
				<br>
				This year 
				To save me from tears <br>

				I'll give it to someone special (special)
				<br>

				<br>
				Once bitten and twice shy 
				<br>
				I keep my distance 
				<br>
				But you still catch my eye 
				<br>
				Tell me baby 
				<br>
				Do you recognize me? 
				<br>
				Well 
				<br>
				It's been a year 
				<br>
				It doesn't surprise me 
				<br>
				<br>
				I wrapped it up and sent it
				<br>
				With a note saying, "I love you, " I meant it
				<br>
				Now, I know what a fool I've been
				<br>
				But if you kissed me now
				<br>
				<br>
				I know you'd fool me again
				<br>
				Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
				<br>
				But the very next day you gave it away
				<br>
				<br>
				This year, to save me from tears
				<br>
				I'll give it to someone special
				<br>
				(Merry Christmas) 
				<br>
				<br>
				Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
				<br>
				But the very next day you gave it away
				<br>
				This year, to save me from tears
				<br>
				I'll give it to someone special
				<br>
				<br>
				A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
				<br>
				I'm hiding from you, and your soul of ice
				<br>
				My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
				<br>
				Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
				<br>
				<br>
				A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
				<br>
				A man under cover but you tore me apart
				<br>
				Now, I've found a real love you'll never fool me again
				<br>
				Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
				<br>
				<br>
				But the very next day you gave it away
				<br>
				This year, to save me from tears
				<br>
				<br>
				I'll give it to someone special.
